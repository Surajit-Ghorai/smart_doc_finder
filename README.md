# Project Title: Intelligent Document Finder with Llama Index

## Objectives:

- Enable users to upload documents of various formats (PDF, PPT, Word, etc.) to a designated Google Drive folder.
- Automate the process of transferring uploaded documents from Google Drive to a server environment where they can be processed and indexed
- Use Llama Index to create a searchable database of the uploaded documents,
  incorporating detailed metadata for each file, such as titles, paragraph numbers, page
  numbers, etc.
- Develop a frontend-based system that interfaces with the indexed data, allowing users to perform searches with the indexed data, returning relevant document snippets along with comprehensive metadata.
