Technical Documentation of Week4 Task 

Project Title: Intelligent Document Finder with Llama Index

Objective of this weeks task:
1. Extend the functionality of the project to support OneDrive.
2. To enable complete integration with Google Drive and OneDrive, granting unrestricted access to all contents, not just folder links.

My approach:
1. First I tried to understand the task requirement, then researched about the topic, then broke the task into features.
2. For the following task, I’m going to add only one feature i.e. OneDrive integration
3. For granting unrestricted access of google drive, i’ll modify the the code of existing feature : Google drive integration
4. I’ll add a functionality so that it can differentiate Google drive folder link and Onedrive folder link. I'm planning on adding a radio button in frontend to select the drive type and choose the data loader accordingly.

Feature:
OneDrive Integration:
	Techstack used:
    1. Python
    2. OneDrive
    3. Microsoft entra
    4. Llama hub
	
	Implementation idea:
    * At first I’m going to register a new application in Microsoft Entra, then in api permissions under microsoft graph, grant permissions of all required APIs.
    * Then retrieve the client id of the application.
    * After that, I'll use the onedrive loader from llamahub to load documents from onedrive. I’ll pass the client id to the onedrive loader.
    * After that I’ll pass the documents in my previous RAG pipeline.
